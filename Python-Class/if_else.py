# How to use If-Else in Python

x = 10
y = 5

if x == y:
    print("Yes, x is equal to y!!!")
else:
    print("No, x is not equal to y!!!")

# Is it mandatory to use else block with if?

# a = 50
# if a == 50:
#     print("Yes, a is equal to 50!!!")
# print("Bye")

a = 40
if a == 50:
    print("Yes, a is equal to 50!!!")
print("Bye")
