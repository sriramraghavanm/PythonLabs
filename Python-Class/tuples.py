# Working with Tuple - Immutable object similar to list

# empty tuple
t1 = ()

# failed assignment and append
# t1.append(3)
# t1[0] = 3

t2 = (20,30,40,50)
print(len(t2))
print(t2)

# Indexing also works for tuple i.e. we can access the elements using their index
# Accessing individual elements from the tuple
print(t2[0])
print(t2[1])
print(t2[2])
print(t2[3])
